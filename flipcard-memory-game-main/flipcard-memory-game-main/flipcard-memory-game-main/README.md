# flipcard-memory-game

Flip is a timed card memory game. Click the green cards to see what symbol they uncover and try to find the matching symbol underneath the other cards. Uncover two matching symbols at once to eliminate them from the game. Eliminate all cards as fast as you can to win the game.
